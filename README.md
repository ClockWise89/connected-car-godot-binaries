# ConnectedCar Godot Binaries

Release artifacts for ConnectedCar Godot binaries (`libgodot.xcframework.zip`).

## Tag convention

Use iOS-focused tags:

- `ios-4.5.1`
- `ios-4.6.0`

## Asset convention

Each release should include:

- `libgodot.xcframework.zip`

Release notes should include the SPM checksum so `connected-car-godot-ios` can update `Package.swift`.
